    "Name": "Black Quinoa, Hulled Millet, Artichoke and Pomegranate Salad",
    "Description": "The inspiration for this recipe came from one of my favourite chefs, vegan guru Tal Ronen who likes to use ancient grains. Tapping into my own ancient Horn of Africa heritage with its African and Middle Eastern influences I have used hulled millet, pomegranate and added ingredients that I don�t usually use such as black quinoa and artichokes. Millet is a common food in much of Africa where it is eaten as a breakfast food in the form of porridge. It is also cooked into a stiff polenta like dish that is served with either vegetables or a meat based sauce.�While many rave about quinoa, millet is not as well known in the western world, but it should be. It is a smart carb that is low GI and has been shown to produce lower blood sugar levels than wheat or rice. (Kamari and Sumathi, 2002). I also used artichokes in this recipe, a vegetable that I am not very familiar with. I have included pictures of how they look like before and after preparation below. Slice about 3/4 inch to an inch off the tip of the artichoke. Pull off any smaller leaves towards the base and on the stem. Wash them in cold water and boil them for about 30 minutes in water. See picture below for what the artichokes should look like once prepared. And this is what your dish could look like once cooked and all the ingredients assembled on the serving plate.

    "Name": "Fenugreek oil seared tofu, spring onions, cherry tomatoes with ginger and lime",
    "Description": "I was beyond flattered when I given the daunting challenge of putting my own twist to the famous chef Tal Ronnen�s vegan menu at the Wynn Luxury Resort in Las Vegas. I started the task with quite a bit of trepidation! This guy is one of the world�s most celebrated chefs, runs the Crossroads restaurant in Los Angeles, and is the author of The Conscious Cook, a New York Times bestselling cookbook. Tal Ronnen is also someone Oprah calls the world�s best vegan chef. I was also daunted by the fact that I had to choose one dish from the menus of the numerous restaurants at the Wynn , named in the�Cond� Nast Traveller� Gold List �as one of the �Top Hotels in the World�. I chose an organic olive oil seared tofu dish prepared with sundried tomatoes, green onions, ginger and lemon soy from Andrea�s, a Forbes Travel Guide Four Star award winning restaurant. I wanted to put a Somali touch to this dish and the idea of using fenugreek seeds and leaves came to mind. Fenugreek is used as a herb (fresh or dried) and a spice when in seed form. In Somali, we call it� hulbad (xulbad) . It is used to spice food and also as a herbal medicine to help women who are breast feeding improve their milk flows. I also decided to substitute the sun dried tomatoes in the original dish with fresh red and gold cherry tomatoes and saut�ed them in fenugreek flavoured oil and lime juice. The resulting juices acted as my dressing and was used in lieu of the lemon soy. I also added rocket leaves as I thought their peppery flavour would go well with the other ingredients. I was delighted with the delicate flavour imparted by the distinctive sweetness of the fenugreek seeds. The fresh tartness of the lime and the slightly caramelised onions, rocket, tomatoes and ginger added a tasty layer of flavour to the tofu. This is definitely a dish that I will cook again. Tal Ronnen, if you ever happen to read my humble take on your dish I hope you think I did a good interpretation! �And to anyone who uses this recipe, I hope you will enjoy the dish as much as I did.

    "Description": "You expect raclette, cheese fondue and rosti in a Swiss kitchen and not tamarind flavoured kebabs, but for Kenyan-born Fatuma the flavours of home have helped her acclimatise to her new world. Fatuma is a keen cook, mother, wife, PhD student and an award winning public relations practitioner with 25 years of experience under her belt. She recently moved to Berne, Switzerland for her new job as head of cabinet for the Universal Postal Union, a specialised�UN agency. Fatuma says she finds cooking therapeutic. �My whole thought process is in the mixing, stirring, tasting and I find it adds to my �me� time where I do what I like at my own pace and time. I also feel good when the end result is appreciated by people�my family love my cooking though I don�t do it much.� Like most Somalis, Fatuma loves meat and spices and learnt to cook at an early age from her mother, but it was the time spent with her grandparents that cemented her connection with food. �My maternal grandpa, God rest his soul, taught me how to make square sabaayad during one of my school holidays in Nyeri, Kenya where my mum was born and brought up. My maternal grandmother used to teach me how to make traditional caano gadod �(special milk) using the roots that were burnt and used to line the diil �(traditional milk container) where the milk was stored to ferment it and that gave the milk that special smell, colour and flavour. �But most of all, I grew up always cooking more than we needed because we never knew who would show up for a meal. Perhaps it was influenced by being a politician�s daughter and there were always people milling around our home that made us do this, but I guess it now affects me because I can never cook for just one person�not used to it. I cook a lot and freeze,� she adds. Fatuma has passed on her love of cooking to her three daughters and two sons. �My son even wanted to be a professional chef at one time � maybe from watching too much Masterchef and Gordon Ramsay and Halimo wants to learn cooking professionally, but it is my eldest, Khadija Iman, who takes after me as she uses her eye to estimate ingredients and does not measure out as most recipes indicate.� Ali, her husband, also chips in and loves to make koroga � a Kenyan dish where meat or chicken is cooked with loads of spices and stirred over a wood or�charcoal�burner for hours until the meat falls off the bone. Tip: You can add bread soaked in water (with the water squeezed out) to the meat. This helps to bind the mince meat. Alternatively, you can add an egg to bind the meat.

How to wrap the sambuus pastry (see pictures above) 1: Thaw the spring roll pastry and cover with a clean cloth to keep the pastry from drying out. 2: Mix two tablespoons of plain flour with a quarter cup of warm water to form a paste to seal the pastry�s edge. 3: Cut the two pastry sheets into thirds of equal size rectangles.� Repeat for the rest of the pastries, using two sheets at a time. In total, you will have 15 rectangles, each forming into one sambuus. Ensure that the pastry pieces are always kept covered with a clean cloth. 4: Fold the two sheets of rectangular pastry into pockets � see picture below. 5: Fill the pocket with about two tablespoons of the vegetable mixture. 6: Spread the flour paste along the edges of the final fold and seal the pastry completely. Ensure that the pastry does not have any holes.� You should have a neat triangular sambuus . A well folded sambuus will fry crisply and won�t be oily. 7: Repeat the process of filling and folding with the remaining pieces of pastry. Keep the pasties covered in cloth to ensure they don�t dry out. Frying the sambuus 1: Heat up oil in a deep frying pan on medium heat. Test the oil with a small strip of excess dough and if the pastry floats up then you are ready to start frying your sambuus . 2: Fry several sambuus at a time until they are a nice golden colour. 3: Drain the sambuus on a clean kitchen towel and serve with a wedge of lemon, lime or shidni sauce. � Prep time: 30 minutes Cook time: 2 hours Total time: 2.5 hours Serves: 8 - 10 people Share this recipe: Facebook Pinterest Google+ Twitter Email You might also like",

Somehow to this day, the smell of coffee brings to mind the sonorous, repetitive and ancient sounds of sacred chant, and I get instantly transported to a state of mental clarity. The d hikr group would sit on a mat and the coffee would be served floating in oil in a kurbin , a special wooden bowl. The kurbin would be passed around and we would start with a deep and appreciative sniff of the wonderful aroma, and then ladle a spoonful of the coffee onto the palm, chew the beans, and then rub the scented oil over our faces. This was part of the ritual and was said to prepare the person to face the world. Sometimes sugar is added to the bun to sweeten it.� Bun is also often eaten with popcorn or a simple dish of boiled azuki beans known as cambuulo . Coffee beans are called� bun �in the Somali language, and� buna �in Oromo and� bunna �in Amharic, the two other main languages of Ethiopia, the home of coffee. Somalis also associate bun with rites and spirit possession practices that hint at the ancient beliefs of Somalis. Ceremonies are held by a ritual expert, calanqad . Dancing, drumming, bun and the burning of incense are used to enhance the senses of participants. The spirit descends on the host under various names, sometimes speaking in different languages. Men and women participate in a ceremony called mingis , but women have their own ceremony called saar . If the spirit is vexatious, an exorcism is conducted by the calanqad . Not all spirits are cast out. Some become friends of the possessed person and are sometimes inherited by the children. Fried coffee beans also play a central role in ceremonies women hold to pray for the safe delivery of a pregnant friend. The oil used to fry the coffee beans is applied liberally on the head and hair of the pregnant woman as the women pray and sing for their friend. The Oromo people of Ethiopia, a Cushitic tribe like the Somali, also have a fried coffee ceremony. The outer skin is snipped off the coffee beans and words of blessings are uttered in a ritual known as buna-chiru , which signifies sacrifice to honour a guest or for a ceremony.

You should have a cone shape with a triangular shaped top that looks like an ice cream cone. 3.�Fill the cone with the mince mixture. 4.�Tuck the pointed top end down over the sealed edges and seal with the paste. You should now have a neat triangular samosa. Repeat with remaining pieces of pastry. Cooking the samosas 1.�Heat the oil in heavy shallow frying pan over medium heat.

    "Name": "Just my cup of tea � Somali shaah redolent with spices",
    "Description": "There is a fine tradition in Somali society known as casariya , a word that is loosely translated to mean afternoon tea. Wonderfully spiced tea called shaah in Somali is often served with various types of sweet or savoury treats. And you never, ever have shaah without sheeko (stories)! If you get invited to a Somali household for casariya beware that you won�t get asked how you like your tea. You will be served tea just the way Somalis like � full of spices and sugar! Cardamom is usually the strongest scent in Somali shaah . Somalis will often ask for tea that has so much cardamom that it should make the person sneeze! Tea with milk is called shaah cadays , however, it is customary to serve black tea called shaah bigays after a heavy meal. This recipe is from Nadia Faragaab aka the �Shaah Queen of Melbourne�. Nadia makes exceptional Somali shaah and always has a good sheeko or two up her sleeve! Nadia started making shaah when she was about 10 years. �My family decided that as the tomboy in the family I should learn to make shaah . It was a way of inducting me into housework,� she jokingly says. �I was also taught how to make canjeero (a Somali sourdough pancake) for breakfast, but I quickly realised that waking up at the crack of dawn wasn�t quite my thing. Making shaah wasn�t dependent on an early morning wake-up call so it became my thing,� adds Nadia. According to Nadia, the interesting thing about making shaah is that somehow each cook�s tea tastes different. �It is almost as if they�ve added a bit of themselves to the tea,� she says. Well, without much ado, here is Nadia�s shaah recipe. Make it your own! This recipe makes four cups of tea.

    "Description": "Shushumow , a crisp, deep fried shell shaped pastry made with flour, eggs and water is a sweet made during festive times such as weddings and religious celebrations among the Somali people. The shushumow also known as kalkals or zinanaande �(in Somali and Barawa languages) is shaped into small balls that is flattened and curled over a fork, deep fried and then tossed in a sugar syrup. The pastry shells are shaped using a fork and sometimes an afro comb (yes, you read that correctly, but of course use a new and sanitised one!). This recipe is courtesy of Hibo Jama of MyHalwad , a great instagram page that you should visit.�Hibo says that she chose the name MyHalwad �because she loves halwa (or xalwa , a popular Somali sweet). �I love xalwad . One day I was craving for it, but where I used to live there was no one who made it. They only got it from other cities. So I called my sister, and as always she told me how to cook xalwa over the phone step by step. It took me about ten tries or so, but I finally got it. Now I put my own twist on it, and that is where the name MyHalwad came from. Xalwa is one of my favorite things to cook,� she says. Hibo started cooking when she was a teenager, but the passion for cooking kicked some years later. �Now I love cooking and baking, and I have been cooking different cuisines for the last 14 years.

Make sure the comb is new and sanitised, and only use it for the shushumow . Instructions Preparing the shushumow 1. In an electric mixer mix all dough ingredients together except the water (and frying oil of course!) 2. Add the water slowly until you get soft dough. Mix for about 4-5 minutes. 3. Then let the dough rest for about 30 minutes. 4. Next cut the dough into small pieces roughly 1 inch x 1 inch. This should give you about 30 shushumow . 5. Shape them one at a time by pressing the dough on the back of the fork and curl it out toward the opposite side (away from you) 6. Preheat oil on medium heat. Fry the shushumow in the preheated oil a few at time, until golden brown. Make sure you turn the pastry frequently so that it cooks evenly. 7. Take them out and place them on a few layers of paper towels. This helps drain the oil from pastry. Preparing the syrup 1. For the syrup, use a medium size pan combine the sugar, cardamom and water together and let it come to a boil. Simmer for a couple of minutes and turn off the heat. 2. Then add all the shushumow to the pan and stir gently and ensure an even coating of the syrup. 3. Take the shushumow out and put them on a plate and let them cool down. The sugar will crystallise, but that�s part of the charm of shushumow ! Enjoy with a cup of Somali shaah .

    "Description": "These delicious bite sized rice cakes are a traditional Swahili breakfast and snack favourite, but I was delighted when I encountered them in the coastal cities of southern Somalia. They are crunchy outside, and soft and fragrant inside. In Swahili we call these delicious cakes vitumbua and macsharo in Somali. Growing up in Mombasa on the Kenyan coast I remember waking up to the call of the vitumbua sellers � vitumbua moto moto (hot, hot vitumbua ). Traditionally, we make the rice cakes in a small hollow pan which holds one cake at a time, but I couldn�t find this type of pan in Australia where I live now. Then a friend told me about the Danish Aebleskiver pan, a cast iron utensil that usually has nine holes � just perfect for cooking mini cakes and I was back in business! You can get the Aebleskiver pan on Amazon or eBay. Incidentally, the macsharo yariis recipe can also be used to make rice pancakes called vibibi and a rice cake also called macsharo or mkate wa sinia in Swahili. This recipe makes about 30 mini cakes. Serve warm with a cup of tea. If eating later, warm the cakes to soften the rice and enhance the flavours.

    "Name": "Somali Polenta Flat Bread (Muufo)",
    "Description": "Traditionally, Somalis bake muufo in a special clay oven called tinaar that is heated by charcoal. The muufo is flattened and stuck on the walls of the tinaar. No oil is ever used. You know the muufo is ready when it falls off the wall. � Muufo is a wonderful bread to serve with soup or stew. As Somalis settled in countries where they didn�t have access to a tinaar , they adapted by using a frying pan or a grill. Once the muufo is cooked on one side, the pan is flipped over to cook the other side directly over the gas flames. The result is an equally delicious flatbread though I have to say that the charcoal cooked tinaar gives the muufo a unique smoky flavour. Some people like to toast the muufo directly over the gas flames by flipping the frying pan onto the heat. This gives the muufo a charred look that makes the taste reminiscent of the muufo cooked in the traditional tinaar . Muufo cooked in this fashion is called muufo gedis (i.e. muufo that is turned). This method of cooking became popular in Somalia during the war as many small businesses such as the tinaar bakery shut down for safety reasons. Visits to the tinaar bakery are a nostalgic memory for girls who grew up in Somalia. It was the duty of young girls to buy the bread at the local tinaar . They would be given a tea towel or small bag to hold the bread and some money. Often, there would be a queue of people waiting for their muufo to be baked. The wait gave the girls a chance to catch up with friends and play. This recipe is from Faiza Hassan, a Somali Sydneysider, who is a wonderful cook. She remembers her mother making muufo in the tinaar in their house. It was years later in Australia that she wrote down her mother�s recipe and used the frying pan and grill to make the muufo bread.

    "Description": "Malawah is a plate sized sweet pancake that is perfect for breakfast or as snack anytime during the day. While there are slight variations in how Somalis make this pancake,� this particular recipe with its fragrant touch of cardamom is how I like my� malawah . While most Somalis call this pancake malawah , this name is used by Yemeni and Jewish people for a different kind of flatbread which Somalis call sabaayad . Regardless of what is it called I love eating malawah �(written as malawax in Somali) with a bit of honey.� My children take it a notch up by spreading nutella on it, and my husband likes it with peanut butter. With a little imagination you could jazz up malawah for dessert! This recipe makes about 25 pancakes. Adjust the ingredients by half to make about 12 pancakes.

We eat them for breakfast, drizzled with butter and a sprinkle of sugar. Anjero also makes a regular appearance at our lunch and dinner tables, usually served with a meat based stew ( maraq ). Anjero (written as canjeero in Somali) is also known as lahooh ( laxoox ). It is similar to the massive sized Ethiopian injera bread. The Somali version is smaller � dinner plate sized and thinner. Somalis make their anjero in various ways. Some people add eggs to the batter. Others use flours such as sorghum. Some Somalis don�t ferment their batter, but I like my anjero fermented. Fermentation gives anjero a tangy sourdough taste that is very moreish! The fermentation process takes two days. Keep a cupful of fermented batter in the fridge to start a fresh batch if you want to make more anjero. Breads similar to anjero are common in Yemen (where it is called lahoh ) and Israel where it was introduced by Yemeni Jews. Moroccans also make a similar bread called baghrir and eat it drizzled with honey and butter.

For breakfast it is eaten with muqmad (dried camel or beef jerky) or fried eggs and a cup of tea. For lunch or dinner it can be accompanied by beef, chicken or vegetable curries. �My favourite way to eat it is to drizzle some honey on the sabaayad . My grandmother used to say that you would know a good cook by the flakiness of their sabayaad . Well, here is how you can make yours as flaky as my granny would want it! You can use all purpose white flour, but this results in a chewy sabaayad. I prefer adding in wholemeal wheat flour which makes the sabaayad soft. To make a circular shaped sabaayad , use your hands to roll the circle from one end to form a cigar like roll. Hold one end and roll into a snake like coil and tuck the end in. Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough into a thin circle. My grandmother rolled the dough twice applying oil with each roll. She said this makes the sabaayad extra flaky and I have to agree that this process does make for a super flaky bread. To make the sabaayad extra flaky roll the dough slightly after spreading the first tablespoonful of oil into a circle or a square. Roll it out again into a bigger circle or square ready for cooking.

They are crunchy outside, and soft and fragrant inside. In Swahili we call these delicious cakes vitumbua and macsharo in Somali. Growing up in Mombasa on the Kenyan coast I remember waking up to the call of the vitumbua sellers � vitumbua moto moto (hot, hot vitumbua ). Traditionally, we make the rice cakes in a small hollow pan which holds one cake at a time, but I couldn�t find this type of pan in Australia where I live now. Then a friend told me about the Danish Aebleskiver pan, a cast iron utensil that usually has nine holes � just perfect for cooking mini cakes and I was back in business! You can get the Aebleskiver pan on Amazon or eBay. Incidentally, the macsharo yariis recipe can also be used to make rice pancakes called vibibi and a rice cake also called macsharo or mkate wa sinia in Swahili. This recipe makes about 30 mini cakes.

    "Name": "Just my cup of tea � Somali shaah redolent with spices",
    "Description": "There is a fine tradition in Somali society known as casariya , a word that is loosely translated to mean afternoon tea. Wonderfully spiced tea called shaah in Somali is often served with various types of sweet or savoury treats. And you never, ever have shaah without sheeko (stories)! If you get invited to a Somali household for casariya beware that you won�t get asked how you like your tea. You will be served tea just the way Somalis like � full of spices and sugar! Cardamom is usually the strongest scent in Somali shaah . Somalis will often ask for tea that has so much cardamom that it should make the person sneeze! Tea with milk is called shaah cadays , however, it is customary to serve black tea called shaah bigays after a heavy meal. This recipe is from Nadia Faragaab aka the �Shaah Queen of Melbourne�. Nadia makes exceptional Somali shaah and always has a good sheeko or two up her sleeve! Nadia started making shaah when she was about 10 years. �My family decided that as the tomboy in the family I should learn to make shaah . It was a way of inducting me into housework,� she jokingly says. �I was also taught how to make canjeero (a Somali sourdough pancake) for breakfast, but I quickly realised that waking up at the crack of dawn wasn�t quite my thing. Making shaah wasn�t dependent on an early morning wake-up call so it became my thing,� adds Nadia. According to Nadia, the interesting thing about making shaah is that somehow each cook�s tea tastes different. �It is almost as if they�ve added a bit of themselves to the tea,� she says. Well, without much ado, here is Nadia�s shaah recipe. Make it your own! This recipe makes four cups of tea.

    "Name": "Somali Polenta Flat Bread (Muufo)",
    "Description": "Traditionally, Somalis bake muufo in a special clay oven called tinaar that is heated by charcoal. The muufo is flattened and stuck on the walls of the tinaar. No oil is ever used. You know the muufo is ready when it falls off the wall. � Muufo is a wonderful bread to serve with soup or stew. As Somalis settled in countries where they didn�t have access to a tinaar , they adapted by using a frying pan or a grill. Once the muufo is cooked on one side, the pan is flipped over to cook the other side directly over the gas flames. The result is an equally delicious flatbread though I have to say that the charcoal cooked tinaar gives the muufo a unique smoky flavour. Some people like to toast the muufo directly over the gas flames by flipping the frying pan onto the heat. This gives the muufo a charred look that makes the taste reminiscent of the muufo cooked in the traditional tinaar . Muufo cooked in this fashion is called muufo gedis (i.e. muufo that is turned). This method of cooking became popular in Somalia during the war as many small businesses such as the tinaar bakery shut down for safety reasons. Visits to the tinaar bakery are a nostalgic memory for girls who grew up in Somalia. It was the duty of young girls to buy the bread at the local tinaar . They would be given a tea towel or small bag to hold the bread and some money. Often, there would be a queue of people waiting for their muufo to be baked. The wait gave the girls a chance to catch up with friends and play. This recipe is from Faiza Hassan, a Somali Sydneysider, who is a wonderful cook. She remembers her mother making muufo in the tinaar in their house. It was years later in Australia that she wrote down her mother�s recipe and used the frying pan and grill to make the muufo bread.

    "Name": "Muqmad (Preserved Meat)",
    "Description": "If there is one dish that is quintessentially Somali this is it!� I call it meat jerky Somali style. For the nomadic Somali people, food at its most basic is all about meat and milk ( hilib iyo caano ) and muqmad or odkac �is up for there for my people. The harsh desert climate and the constant travel meant that Somalis had to invent ways to make foods that would last for long periods of time, such as muqmad or odkac � which is preserved meat. The muqmad would keep for up to one year, which made it a wonderful source of continuous protein and energy for the ever roving nomads. Huge amounts of meat would be cut into thin strips and then sun dried. After a couple of days in the sun, the meat would be cut into tiny half a centimetre cubes and then deep fried and preserved in ghee. Once the meat was cooked it would be kept in a wooden container. Muqmad is also prepared for weddings and placed in a special container called xeedho (in the picture), which is decorated with leather and sea shells.� The xeedho is then be wrapped in cloth and given as a gift to the groom�s family members. As a child I remember my grandmother slicing the meat in our backyard and hanging it on the washing line!� It was my job and that of my siblings to sit by the clothesline and shoo the birds away, much as my uncles and aunts did in the desert, except of course they didn�t have clotheslines to hang their meat on. This muqmad recipe is from my mother via her mother and grandmother � ladies who were true nomads or reer guraa as we say in Somali.� My grandmother always liked to flavour the ghee with a bit of onion, garlic and cardamom. She said it gave the meat a wonderful depth of flavour, and everyone who�tastes it�agrees! This recipe doesn�t require you to cure the meat by drying it in the sun, and takes a short cut by simply deep frying it. Our local butcher has many Somali customers and has learnt to cut the meat in muqmad or odkac �style.� If you aren�t as lucky as we are, dice the lean beef into tiny quarter centimetre cubes. Muqmad is a favourite breakfast food and is usually eaten with sabaayad bread or anjero . If you�ve read this far then you should keep in touch!� Like The Somali Kitchen on�Facebook .

Anjero (written as canjeero in Somali) is also known as lahooh ( laxoox ). It is similar to the massive sized Ethiopian injera bread. The Somali version is smaller � dinner plate sized and thinner. Somalis make their anjero in various ways. Some people add eggs to the batter. Others use flours such as sorghum. Some Somalis don�t ferment their batter, but I like my anjero fermented. Fermentation gives anjero a tangy sourdough taste that is very moreish! The fermentation process takes two days. Keep a cupful of fermented batter in the fridge to start a fresh batch if you want to make more anjero. Breads similar to anjero are common in Yemen (where it is called lahoh ) and Israel where it was introduced by Yemeni Jews. Moroccans also make a similar bread called baghrir and eat it drizzled with honey and butter.

    "Description": "Sabaayad is similar to the Indian paratha. This is versatile bread that can be eaten for breakfast, lunch, dinner or just by itself. For breakfast it is eaten with muqmad (dried camel or beef jerky) or fried eggs and a cup of tea. For lunch or dinner it can be accompanied by beef, chicken or vegetable curries. �My favourite way to eat it is to drizzle some honey on the sabaayad . My grandmother used to say that you would know a good cook by the flakiness of their sabayaad . Well, here is how you can make yours as flaky as my granny would want it! You can use all purpose white flour, but this results in a chewy sabaayad. I prefer adding in wholemeal wheat flour which makes the sabaayad soft. To make a circular shaped sabaayad , use your hands to roll the circle from one end to form a cigar like roll. Hold one end and roll into a snake like coil and tuck the end in. Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough into a thin circle. My grandmother rolled the dough twice applying oil with each roll. She said this makes the sabaayad extra flaky and I have to agree that this process does make for a super flaky bread. To make the sabaayad extra flaky roll the dough slightly after spreading the first tablespoonful of oil into a circle or a square. Roll it out again into a bigger circle or square ready for cooking.

Mix all the flour together with the salt. Add the oil and mix in thoroughly. Add in the water slowly as you knead the dough. When you are satisfied that you have a firm and elastic dough you know you�ve got it right. Let the dough rest for about half an hour. 2. Cut the dough into eight equal portions. Roll out each portion into a circle. Spread one teaspoon of oil and rub it gently all over the surface of the dough. To make the sabaayad square shaped, use a rolling pin to roll the circle and fold it into a square. This will allow you to achieve a square shape when you roll the dough. If the dough is sticky pat it with some flour. 3. Heat up a frying pan or griddle on the stove. When hot place the thinly rolled dough and let it cook for a minute or so. Once it starts to puff up flip the sabaayad and immediately spread a teaspoon of oil on top. Use a spatula to press down the bread all around. This makes it puff up more evenly. Flip and cook on the other side. 4. Remove from the heat and place on a plate.

    "Name": "Mango Chicken Curry from a Somali kitchen in Minneapolis",
    "Description": "Chef Jamal Hashi, co-owner (with his brother Sade Hashi) of Safari Express East African Restaurant in Minneapolis, Minnesota says: �I owe it to the Italians that I make a �great marinara.� Hashi was born and raised in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, and immigrated to the US with his family as a teenager. Hashi says that Somali cuisine has been shaped by diverse influences over centuries and that it is fusion that makes the cuisine special. �Somalia was divided into three �parts: The north was �French, the middle was the�UK �red coats,� and the south, Italian.� He says: �You can�t say there�s Somali this or that, but each region is special. The �south is known for sweets, pasta, and marinara. The north gets influences from Djibouti. The way we use spice is different, from the north to the south.� With respect to home cooking in his family growing up, Hashi says: �My father specializes in seafood.� In Somalia, recipes are typically not written down, but passed down through family. Or, Hashi says: �People can guess, play around with the spices.� Hashi�s own interest �in cooking sparked at home. �Something about food called to me. It started as a hobby, in the home. I loved playing around with food, watching others cook for me. �There�s an artistry to it. Playing with fire, and the textures; it�s an art in a way. I love the gratitude of people when you serve it to them. It�s a good feeling.� Somalia�s location on the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden historically enabled active trading with India, Pakistan, and the Middle East, particularly Yemen. �We get mixed fusion, the cultures blended into one. So, we have curry with pasta. And beef marinara. We use both potatoes and pasta. Crepes with sesame oil and brown sugar is very common. In Ethiopia, their injera is soft and spongy, made from teff. Somali injera also includes butter and milk.� Most Somalis observe halal dietary guidelines. He says the rules govern �mostly how the meat is prepped.� While Somali cuisine may be unfamiliar to many Americans, opportunities to try it, particularly in Minneapolis, are increasing. According to the Minneapolis Foundation,�Minnesota is home to the country�s largest population of Somali residents.� Estimates vary, but the Confederation of Somali Community indicates that, since 1991, 100,000 Somalis have settled in the United States, 40,000 of which have settled or re-settled in Minnesota. Safari Express is one of the estimated (by the Minneapolis Foundation) 120 African-owned businesses, including markets and restaurants, along Minneapolis� Lake Street corridor. Chef Jamal Hashi graciously accommodated the Heavy Table�s request to spend an evening grocery shopping and cooking with us, in order to provide more insight into Somali cuisine. He showed us how to make a dish not available on the menu at Safari Express: Mango (Ambe, pronounced �ahm-bay�) Curry Chicken with Somali Rice, which is a colorful dish, fragrant with the scents of cumin and curry. It�s both mildly sweet and spicy. Says Hashi: �The mango brings the spice down and balances everything out.� Hashi kicked off our evening of shopping and cooking with a stop at The Produce Exchange, in Midtown Global Market in Minneapolis, in search of ripe mangoes. �I love using organic produce at home and at Safari Express, too. It tastes like the way we do it back home. Fruits don�t taste like fruits here [in the US]. There are lots of good things about organics: They are good for your system, have fewer chemicals, and have health benefits over the long-term. And it supports local businesses.� He says that a ripe mango �should be a little soft when you squeeze it. The firmer it is, the more sour it is. It doesn�t matter what color the skin is: it might be green, but still sweet.� As Hashi patiently sorted through the mangoes, gently squeezing each one, a process that took several minutes, he said: �Back home, we had a big mango tree behind our house. It was our neighbors� tree, but half hung over",

    "Description": "Fried coffee? I know what you are thinking! It sounds weird, right? But let me tell you the taste is incredible and Somalis have some interesting stories that we associate with the bean. My beloved maternal grandparents introduced me to fried coffee beans at the tender age of five. This special dish was offered during meditation sessions called dhikr , an Islamic form of devotional chanting in praise of God. Somehow to this day, the smell of coffee brings to mind the sonorous, repetitive and ancient sounds of sacred chant, and I get instantly transported to a state of mental clarity. The d hikr group would sit on a mat and the coffee would be served floating in oil in a kurbin , a special wooden bowl. The kurbin would be passed around and we would start with a deep and appreciative sniff of the wonderful aroma, and then ladle a spoonful of the coffee onto the palm, chew the beans, and then rub the scented oil over our faces. This was part of the ritual and was said to prepare the person to face the world. Sometimes sugar is added to the bun to sweeten it.� Bun is also often eaten with popcorn or a simple dish of boiled azuki beans known as cambuulo . Coffee beans are called� bun �in the Somali language, and� buna �in Oromo and� bunna �in Amharic, the two other main languages of Ethiopia, the home of coffee. Somalis also associate bun with rites and spirit possession practices that hint at the ancient beliefs of Somalis. Ceremonies are held by a ritual expert, calanqad . Dancing, drumming, bun and the burning of incense are used to enhance the senses of participants. The spirit descends on the host under various names, sometimes speaking in different languages. Men and women participate in a ceremony called mingis , but women have their own ceremony called saar . If the spirit is vexatious, an exorcism is conducted by the calanqad . Not all spirits are cast out. Some become friends of the possessed person and are sometimes inherited by the children. Fried coffee beans also play a central role in ceremonies women hold to pray for the safe delivery of a pregnant friend. The oil used to fry the coffee beans is applied liberally on the head and hair of the pregnant woman as the women pray and sing for their friend. The Oromo people of Ethiopia, a Cushitic tribe like the Somali, also have a fried coffee ceremony. The outer skin is snipped off the coffee beans and words of blessings are uttered in a ritual known as buna-chiru , which signifies sacrifice to honour a guest or for a ceremony.

    "Description": "This spicy chilli sauce is a favourite of all Somalis. Usually it is made as described below, but some people add dates. Another version is made with onions, tomatoes and lemon or with dates and tamarind . We have shidni with almost every meal. You can get tamarind either whole or in a paste form in any Indian or Somali grocery store. I recommend the paste as it is easier to use. The tamarind tree, which is called raqay or xamar in Somali (the latter is also the local name for the Somali capital Mogadishu) grows in the tropical parts of East Africa, including southern Somalia. The tree produces fleshy pods that are brown or reddish-brown when mature. The pods are soaked in water and squeezed to produce a thick acidic paste. When we were children we loved mixing the juice with water and sugar to make a refreshing drink, but that is a recipe for another day! Give shidni a go if you want to add a spicy kick to your meal. Incidentally, shidni makes a great dip for French fries or Dorito chips. Remember to pick the variety of chillies carefully. The colour and size of chillies are not indicative of the intensity of their flavour. The hottest part of the chilli is the membrane and the seeds. You can remove these to reduce the heat. You don�t want it too hot if you can�t bear the heat! And if the shidni is too hot please don�t drink water. Sipping some milk or yoghurt cools you down much faster. Want to learn getting your Somali pronunciation right? In Somali, the letter x is pronounced as an emphatic version of the letter h . If you are not Somali here is a fun way to learn how to make this sound�swallow a good spoonful of really hot shidni sauce. Did you just make an exhaling sound when the heat of the chilli hit your palate? Well, that is a good approximation of the Somali x !

You will need to make the sabaayad and muqmad in advance. �The sabaayad can be kept in the freezer and warmed up as and when you need it. The muqmad keeps for about a year, which makes it a handy source of protein. �All you need to make on the spot are the eggs. �So essentially you could be having this sort of brekkie for a long time! �And in case you like the idea but can�t make the muqmad and sabaayad , the idea is there for borrowing. � Use any kind of flatbread, dice up some beef for a quick stir fry and follow the recipe below.

    "Description": "Goat is a popular meat amongst the nomadic Somali people who praise its soft, juicy taste. Roasting the goat whole is the preferred method of cooking. In this recipe I have used a spice blend to marinate the meat. The result is soft, succulent, fall off the bone meat that is packed with flavour. While goat cheese and milk are an accepted part of the gourmet menu, goat meat is still relatively unknown in western countries, but it is gaining popularity as a healthy red meat. It is lower in fat than chicken and higher in protein than beef. It also has higher iron than beef. Goats are a sustainable animal to farm as they are browsers, not grazers and have a smaller impact on the land. They are drought tolerant and ideally suited to the dry semi-arid lands of the Somali people. Somalia has its own variety of goat. The Somali goat ( deg yar ) has short ears and hair. It is usually white in colour, but sometimes has dark spots or patches. If you�ve read this far then you should keep in touch!� Like The Somali Kitchen on�Facebook .

    "Description": "You expect raclette, cheese fondue and rosti in a Swiss kitchen and not tamarind flavoured kebabs, but for Kenyan-born Fatuma the flavours of home have helped her acclimatise to her new world. Fatuma is a keen cook, mother, wife, PhD student and an award winning public relations practitioner with 25 years of experience under her belt. She recently moved to Berne, Switzerland for her new job as head of cabinet for the Universal Postal Union, a specialised�UN agency. Fatuma says she finds cooking therapeutic. �My whole thought process is in the mixing, stirring, tasting and I find it adds to my �me� time where I do what I like at my own pace and time. I also feel good when the end result is appreciated by people�my family love my cooking though I don�t do it much.� Like most Somalis, Fatuma loves meat and spices and learnt to cook at an early age from her mother, but it was the time spent with her grandparents that cemented her connection with food. �My maternal grandpa, God rest his soul, taught me how to make square sabaayad during one of my school holidays in Nyeri, Kenya where my mum was born and brought up. My maternal grandmother used to teach me how to make traditional caano gadod �(special milk) using the roots that were burnt and used to line the diil �(traditional milk container) where the milk was stored to ferment it and that gave the milk that special smell, colour and flavour. �But most of all, I grew up always cooking more than we needed because we never knew who would show up for a meal. Perhaps it was influenced by being a politician�s daughter and there were always people milling around our home that made us do this, but I guess it now affects me because I can never cook for just one person�not used to it. I cook a lot and freeze,� she adds. Fatuma has passed on her love of cooking to her three daughters and two sons. �My son even wanted to be a professional chef at one time � maybe from watching too much Masterchef and Gordon Ramsay and Halimo wants to learn cooking professionally, but it is my eldest, Khadija Iman, who takes after me as she uses her eye to estimate ingredients and does not measure out as most recipes indicate.� Ali, her husband, also chips in and loves to make koroga � a Kenyan dish where meat or chicken is cooked with loads of spices and stirred over a wood or�charcoal�burner for hours until the meat falls off the bone. Tip: You can add bread soaked in water (with the water squeezed out) to the meat. This helps to bind the mince meat. Alternatively, you can add an egg to bind the meat. I find the meat binds together without these if done while meat is fresh and not frozen. If you�ve read this far then you should keep in touch!� Like The Somali Kitchen on�Facebook .

    "Name": "Muqmad (Preserved Meat)",
    "Description": "If there is one dish that is quintessentially Somali this is it!� I call it meat jerky Somali style. For the nomadic Somali people, food at its most basic is all about meat and milk ( hilib iyo caano ) and muqmad or odkac �is up for there for my people. The harsh desert climate and the constant travel meant that Somalis had to invent ways to make foods that would last for long periods of time, such as muqmad or odkac � which is preserved meat. The muqmad would keep for up to one year, which made it a wonderful source of continuous protein and energy for the ever roving nomads. Huge amounts of meat would be cut into thin strips and then sun dried. After a couple of days in the sun, the meat would be cut into tiny half a centimetre cubes and then deep fried and preserved in ghee. Once the meat was cooked it would be kept in a wooden container. Muqmad is also prepared for weddings and placed in a special container called xeedho (in the picture), which is decorated with leather and sea shells.� The xeedho is then be wrapped in cloth and given as a gift to the groom�s family members. As a child I remember my grandmother slicing the meat in our backyard and hanging it on the washing line!� It was my job and that of my siblings to sit by the clothesline and shoo the birds away, much as my uncles and aunts did in the desert, except of course they didn�t have clotheslines to hang their meat on. This muqmad recipe is from my mother via her mother and grandmother � ladies who were true nomads or reer guraa as we say in Somali.� My grandmother always liked to flavour the ghee with a bit of onion, garlic and cardamom. She said it gave the meat a wonderful depth of flavour, and everyone who�tastes it�agrees! This recipe doesn�t require you to cure the meat by drying it in the sun, and takes a short cut by simply deep frying it. Our local butcher has many Somali customers and has learnt to cut the meat in muqmad or odkac �style.� If you aren�t as lucky as we are, dice the lean beef into tiny quarter centimetre cubes.

    "Name": "Zab (Roast Lamb)",
    "Description": "Zab is the name given to a Somali dish of roast lamb or goat served over a bed of rice. The dish is usually served during weddings or community gatherings known as Zab or alla bari . Consequently many call the dish Zab . When I came to Australia I cooked Zab almost every other week. This was a great way to bring together my husband�s extended family and for my children to get to know their family and learn about the Somali culture. I cooked my first Zab when I was fifteen years of age for twenty people at my niece�s wanqal (a traditional Somali naming ceremony). This was a great achievement for me, and years later Zab has become my signature dish! This is a slow cooking dish, but most of the work will be done for you by the oven so don�t be scared to try it. I guarantee you that the results will be worth it! Serve the big chunks of tender meat on a bed of rice in a big dish for a Zab effect. There should be plenty to share for more than eight hungry people! If you have leftovers wrap the lamb in baking paper and a layer of foil paper. Store in the fridge for up to three days.� Sliced pieces of the meat make a great sandwich filler for the kids school lunch.

    "Description": "Shushumow , a crisp, deep fried shell shaped pastry made with flour, eggs and water is a sweet made during festive times such as weddings and religious celebrations among the Somali people. The shushumow also known as kalkals or zinanaande �(in Somali and Barawa languages) is shaped into small balls that is flattened and curled over a fork, deep fried and then tossed in a sugar syrup. The pastry shells are shaped using a fork and sometimes an afro comb (yes, you read that correctly, but of course use a new and sanitised one!). This recipe is courtesy of Hibo Jama of MyHalwad , a great instagram page that you should visit.�Hibo says that she chose the name MyHalwad �because she loves halwa (or xalwa , a popular Somali sweet). �I love xalwad . One day I was craving for it, but where I used to live there was no one who made it. They only got it from other cities. So I called my sister, and as always she told me how to cook xalwa over the phone step by step. It took me about ten tries or so, but I finally got it. Now I put my own twist on it, and that is where the name MyHalwad came from. Xalwa is one of my favorite things to cook,� she says. Hibo started cooking when she was a teenager, but the passion for cooking kicked some years later. �Now I love cooking and baking, and I have been cooking different cuisines for the last 14 years.

Print  Shushumow (Somali Crystallised Pastry Shells)  Author:  Abderazzaq Noor  Recipe by:  Hibo Jama of MyHalwad Ingredients Shushumow dough 1 _ cups all-purpose flour 3 tablespoon of sugar _ teaspoon salt _ teaspoon baking powder 1/3 cup of canola oil 1 large egg 3 tablespoon of warm water (more or less) 2 cups of canola oil (for frying) Sugar syrup _ cup sugar _ cup water _ ground cardamom (optional) Supplies for shaping the shushumow A flat board A fork or new afro comb (you can get this online). Make sure the comb is new and sanitised, and only use it for the shushumow . Instructions Preparing the shushumow 1. In an electric mixer mix all dough ingredients together except the water (and frying oil of course!) 2. Add the water slowly until you get soft dough. Mix for about 4-5 minutes. 3. Then let the dough rest for about 30 minutes. 4. Next cut the dough into small pieces roughly 1 inch x 1 inch. This should give you about 30 shushumow . 5. Shape them one at a time by pressing the dough on the back of the fork and curl it out toward the opposite side (away from you) 6. Preheat oil on medium heat. Fry the shushumow in the preheated oil a few at time, until golden brown. Make sure you turn the pastry frequently so that it cooks evenly. 7. Take them out and place them on a few layers of paper towels. This helps drain the oil from pastry. Preparing the syrup 1. For the syrup, use a medium size pan combine the sugar, cardamom and water together and let it come to a boil. Simmer for a couple of minutes and turn off the heat. 2. Then add all the shushumow to the pan and stir gently and ensure an even coating of the syrup. 3. Take the shushumow out and put them on a plate and let them cool down. The sugar will crystallise, but that�s part of the charm of shushumow ! Enjoy with a cup of Somali shaah .

    "Name": "Black Quinoa, Hulled Millet, Artichoke and Pomegranate Salad",
    "Description": "The inspiration for this recipe came from one of my favourite chefs, vegan guru Tal Ronen who likes to use ancient grains. Tapping into my own ancient Horn of Africa heritage with its African and Middle Eastern influences I have used hulled millet, pomegranate and added ingredients that I don�t usually use such as black quinoa and artichokes. Millet is a common food in much of Africa where it is eaten as a breakfast food in the form of porridge. It is also cooked into a stiff polenta like dish that is served with either vegetables or a meat based sauce.�While many rave about quinoa, millet is not as well known in the western world, but it should be. It is a smart carb that is low GI and has been shown to produce lower blood sugar levels than wheat or rice. (Kamari and Sumathi, 2002). I also used artichokes in this recipe, a vegetable that I am not very familiar with. I have included pictures of how they look like before and after preparation below. Slice about 3/4 inch to an inch off the tip of the artichoke. Pull off any smaller leaves towards the base and on the stem. Wash them in cold water and boil them for about 30 minutes in water. See picture below for what the artichokes should look like once prepared. And this is what your dish could look like once cooked and all the ingredients assembled on the serving plate.

This makes Somali food perfect for those who like flavour without the heat, but for those who like it hot�the more the chilli the better!

Jamal�s version, called bizbaz , is particularly delicious and has layers of complex flavour that belie its simple ingredients. There are many versions of this chilli sauce ( bisbas , basbas , or shidni are the various names given to this type of sauce). Common ingredients include yoghurt, tomato, tamarind, lime or lemon, sugar, dates, and of course chilli. You can serve this chilli sauce with almost anything.

Fava beans are a common food in north east Africa and much of the middle east, particularly in Egypt where it is known as ful medames. The Egyptians like their ful served boiled with a sprinkle of cumin, olive oil and a squeeze of lemon. I much prefer our saucier north east African version. What brings this dish to life is the addition of berbere, a spicy Ethiopian spice mix that contains ginger, cardamom, cloves, chillies, coriander, and other spices. You can get berbere in most African grocery stores. If you can�t get hold of berbere, use a tablespoon of ground spices that include minced ginger, ground cardamom, ground cumin, ground cinnamon, ground black pepper and paprika.

    "Description": "I was beyond flattered when I given the daunting challenge of putting my own twist to the famous chef Tal Ronnen�s vegan menu at the Wynn Luxury Resort in Las Vegas. I started the task with quite a bit of trepidation! This guy is one of the world�s most celebrated chefs, runs the Crossroads restaurant in Los Angeles, and is the author of The Conscious Cook, a New York Times bestselling cookbook. Tal Ronnen is also someone Oprah calls the world�s best vegan chef. I was also daunted by the fact that I had to choose one dish from the menus of the numerous restaurants at the Wynn , named in the�Cond� Nast Traveller� Gold List �as one of the �Top Hotels in the World�. I chose an organic olive oil seared tofu dish prepared with sundried tomatoes, green onions, ginger and lemon soy from Andrea�s, a Forbes Travel Guide Four Star award winning restaurant. I wanted to put a Somali touch to this dish and the idea of using fenugreek seeds and leaves came to mind. Fenugreek is used as a herb (fresh or dried) and a spice when in seed form. In Somali, we call it� hulbad (xulbad) . It is used to spice food and also as a herbal medicine to help women who are breast feeding improve their milk flows. I also decided to substitute the sun dried tomatoes in the original dish with fresh red and gold cherry tomatoes and saut�ed them in fenugreek flavoured oil and lime juice. The resulting juices acted as my dressing and was used in lieu of the lemon soy. I also added rocket leaves as I thought their peppery flavour would go well with the other ingredients. I was delighted with the delicate flavour imparted by the distinctive sweetness of the fenugreek seeds. The fresh tartness of the lime and the slightly caramelised onions, rocket, tomatoes and ginger added a tasty layer of flavour to the tofu. This is definitely a dish that I will cook again. Tal Ronnen, if you ever happen to read my humble take on your dish I hope you think I did a good interpretation! �And to anyone who uses this recipe, I hope you will enjoy the dish as much as I did.

    "Name": "Mango Chicken Curry from a Somali kitchen in Minneapolis",
    "Description": "Chef Jamal Hashi, co-owner (with his brother Sade Hashi) of Safari Express East African Restaurant in Minneapolis, Minnesota says: �I owe it to the Italians that I make a �great marinara.� Hashi was born and raised in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, and immigrated to the US with his family as a teenager. Hashi says that Somali cuisine has been shaped by diverse influences over centuries and that it is fusion that makes the cuisine special. �Somalia was divided into three �parts: The north was �French, the middle was the�UK �red coats,� and the south, Italian.� He says: �You can�t say there�s Somali this or that, but each region is special. The �south is known for sweets, pasta, and marinara. The north gets influences from Djibouti. The way we use spice is different, from the north to the south.� With respect to home cooking in his family growing up, Hashi says: �My father specializes in seafood.� In Somalia, recipes are typically not written down, but passed down through family. Or, Hashi says: �People can guess, play around with the spices.� Hashi�s own interest �in cooking sparked at home. �Something about food called to me. It started as a hobby, in the home. I loved playing around with food, watching others cook for me. �There�s an artistry to it. Playing with fire, and the textures; it�s an art in a way. I love the gratitude of people when you serve it to them. It�s a good feeling.� Somalia�s location on the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden historically enabled active trading with India, Pakistan, and the Middle East, particularly Yemen. �We get mixed fusion, the cultures blended into one. So, we have curry with pasta. And beef marinara. We use both potatoes and pasta. Crepes with sesame oil and brown sugar is very common. In Ethiopia, their injera is soft and spongy, made from teff. Somali injera also includes butter and milk.� Most Somalis observe halal dietary guidelines. He says the rules govern �mostly how the meat is prepped.� While Somali cuisine may be unfamiliar to many Americans, opportunities to try it, particularly in Minneapolis, are increasing. According to the Minneapolis Foundation,�Minnesota is home to the country�s largest population of Somali residents.� Estimates vary, but the Confederation of Somali Community indicates that, since 1991, 100,000 Somalis have settled in the United States, 40,000 of which have settled or re-settled in Minnesota. Safari Express is one of the estimated (by the Minneapolis Foundation) 120 African-owned businesses, including markets and restaurants, along Minneapolis� Lake Street corridor. Chef Jamal Hashi graciously accommodated the Heavy Table�s request to spend an evening grocery shopping and cooking with us, in order to provide more insight into Somali cuisine. He showed us how to make a dish not available on the menu at Safari Express: Mango (Ambe, pronounced �ahm-bay�) Curry Chicken with Somali Rice, which is a colorful dish, fragrant with the scents of cumin and curry. It�s both mildly sweet and spicy. Says Hashi: �The mango brings the spice down and balances everything out.� Hashi kicked off our evening of shopping and cooking with a stop at The Produce Exchange, in Midtown Global Market in Minneapolis, in search of ripe mangoes. �I love using organic produce at home and at Safari Express, too. It tastes like the way we do it back home. Fruits don�t taste like fruits here [in the US]. There are lots of good things about organics: They are good for your system, have fewer chemicals, and have health benefits over the long-term. And it supports local businesses.� He says that a ripe mango �should be a little soft when you squeeze it. The firmer it is, the more sour it is. It doesn�t matter what color the skin is: it might be green, but still sweet.� As Hashi patiently sorted through the mangoes, gently squeezing each one, a process that took several minutes, he said: �Back home, we had a big mango tree behind our house. It was our neighbors� tree, but half hung over",
    "Ingredients": "Mango (Ambe) Sauce: 1 cup coconut milk 1 teaspoon curry powder (either mild or hot) _ teaspoon cumin _ teaspoon (or more, depending on how sweet you like it) organic brown sugar _ cup mango pulp",
    "Instructions": "Mango (Ambe) Sauce: 1.In a saucepan over high heat, heat coconut milk until boiling. Stir occasionally. 2.Add curry powder and cumin. Turn fire low, to simmer. Stir constantly until there are no lumps (about 10 minutes), until the mixture is smooth and an even yellow color, and no little dots of color or spice remain. 3.Add brown sugar and continue to stir until the mixture is a little thicker, with the consistency of a syrup. 4.Add mango pulp and stir. Let sauce get a little thicker.",

    "Name": "Polenta African Style (Soor)",
    "Description": "This stiff, porridge like dish made from maize flour and water is practically the national dish in many African countries. In Somali we call this African dish soor . It is usually eaten using the hand. You pick up a small amount using three fingers and form a ball to scoop vegetables or meat. It won�t take long to get the hang of eating this way, but do take your time if you are eating with me as I usually get a kick watching novices try! Soor has many names around Africa� sima or ugali in Kenya and Tanzania where it is also made using maize flour though sometimes red millet flour is used as well. In Malawi and Zambia it is called nsima,�pap or mealie in South Africa. In west African countries such as Nigeria a soor like variation called fufu is made using cassava flour. Soor has a subtle almost bland flavour that is best matched with a fully flavoured vegetable or meat dish. In Somalia butter and milk is sometimes added to the ingredients to soften the soor . In most other African countries the dish is made with just maize flour and water. At times I add various other flavourings such as a pinch of black pepper and cheese and it tastes amazing. It is said that when you eat soor it sticks to your ribs, keeping you full and satisfied for longer. Serve with vegetables or meat such as suqaar or lamb and potato sugo . I love eating soor with yoghurt and a drizzle of honey. Many Somalis like to eat soor with milk and sugar.

    "Description": "These delicious bite sized rice cakes are a traditional Swahili breakfast and snack favourite, but I was delighted when I encountered them in the coastal cities of southern Somalia. They are crunchy outside, and soft and fragrant inside. In Swahili we call these delicious cakes vitumbua and macsharo in Somali. Growing up in Mombasa on the Kenyan coast I remember waking up to the call of the vitumbua sellers � vitumbua moto moto (hot, hot vitumbua ). Traditionally, we make the rice cakes in a small hollow pan which holds one cake at a time, but I couldn�t find this type of pan in Australia where I live now. Then a friend told me about the Danish Aebleskiver pan, a cast iron utensil that usually has nine holes � just perfect for cooking mini cakes and I was back in business! You can get the Aebleskiver pan on Amazon or eBay. Incidentally, the macsharo yariis recipe can also be used to make rice pancakes called vibibi and a rice cake also called macsharo or mkate wa sinia in Swahili. This recipe makes about 30 mini cakes. Serve warm with a cup of tea. If eating later, warm the cakes to soften the rice and enhance the flavours.

While goat cheese and milk are an accepted part of the gourmet menu, goat meat is still relatively unknown in western countries, but it is gaining popularity as a healthy red meat. It is lower in fat than chicken and higher in protein than beef. It also has higher iron than beef. Goats are a sustainable animal to farm as they are browsers, not grazers and have a smaller impact on the land. They are drought tolerant and ideally suited to the dry semi-arid lands of the Somali people. Somalia has its own variety of goat. The Somali goat ( deg yar ) has short ears and hair.

    "Description": "You expect raclette, cheese fondue and rosti in a Swiss kitchen and not tamarind flavoured kebabs, but for Kenyan-born Fatuma the flavours of home have helped her acclimatise to her new world. Fatuma is a keen cook, mother, wife, PhD student and an award winning public relations practitioner with 25 years of experience under her belt. She recently moved to Berne, Switzerland for her new job as head of cabinet for the Universal Postal Union, a specialised�UN agency. Fatuma says she finds cooking therapeutic. �My whole thought process is in the mixing, stirring, tasting and I find it adds to my �me� time where I do what I like at my own pace and time. I also feel good when the end result is appreciated by people�my family love my cooking though I don�t do it much.� Like most Somalis, Fatuma loves meat and spices and learnt to cook at an early age from her mother, but it was the time spent with her grandparents that cemented her connection with food. �My maternal grandpa, God rest his soul, taught me how to make square sabaayad during one of my school holidays in Nyeri, Kenya where my mum was born and brought up. My maternal grandmother used to teach me how to make traditional caano gadod �(special milk) using the roots that were burnt and used to line the diil �(traditional milk container) where the milk was stored to ferment it and that gave the milk that special smell, colour and flavour. �But most of all, I grew up always cooking more than we needed because we never knew who would show up for a meal. Perhaps it was influenced by being a politician�s daughter and there were always people milling around our home that made us do this, but I guess it now affects me because I can never cook for just one person�not used to it. I cook a lot and freeze,� she adds. Fatuma has passed on her love of cooking to her three daughters and two sons. �My son even wanted to be a professional chef at one time � maybe from watching too much Masterchef and Gordon Ramsay and Halimo wants to learn cooking professionally, but it is my eldest, Khadija Iman, who takes after me as she uses her eye to estimate ingredients and does not measure out as most recipes indicate.� Ali, her husband, also chips in and loves to make koroga � a Kenyan dish where meat or chicken is cooked with loads of spices and stirred over a wood or�charcoal�burner for hours until the meat falls off the bone. Tip: You can add bread soaked in water (with the water squeezed out) to the meat. This helps to bind the mince meat. Alternatively, you can add an egg to bind the meat.

    "Name": "Just my cup of tea � Somali shaah redolent with spices",
    "Description": "There is a fine tradition in Somali society known as casariya , a word that is loosely translated to mean afternoon tea. Wonderfully spiced tea called shaah in Somali is often served with various types of sweet or savoury treats. And you never, ever have shaah without sheeko (stories)! If you get invited to a Somali household for casariya beware that you won�t get asked how you like your tea. You will be served tea just the way Somalis like � full of spices and sugar! Cardamom is usually the strongest scent in Somali shaah . Somalis will often ask for tea that has so much cardamom that it should make the person sneeze! Tea with milk is called shaah cadays , however, it is customary to serve black tea called shaah bigays after a heavy meal. This recipe is from Nadia Faragaab aka the �Shaah Queen of Melbourne�. Nadia makes exceptional Somali shaah and always has a good sheeko or two up her sleeve! Nadia started making shaah when she was about 10 years. �My family decided that as the tomboy in the family I should learn to make shaah . It was a way of inducting me into housework,� she jokingly says. �I was also taught how to make canjeero (a Somali sourdough pancake) for breakfast, but I quickly realised that waking up at the crack of dawn wasn�t quite my thing. Making shaah wasn�t dependent on an early morning wake-up call so it became my thing,� adds Nadia. According to Nadia, the interesting thing about making shaah is that somehow each cook�s tea tastes different. �It is almost as if they�ve added a bit of themselves to the tea,� she says. Well, without much ado, here is Nadia�s shaah recipe. Make it your own! This recipe makes four cups of tea.

Other cultures have similar pastries.� The Spanish and Portuguese have empanada , the Polish are proud of their pirogi , the English and Aussies love their meatpie, and the Chinese continue to dazzle us with spring-rolls. In this recipe I have used spring roll pastry instead of the traditional handmade pastry. Using spring rolls is quick and easy, but if you prefer to make your own pastry, check out our meat sambuus recipe for instructions.

Print  Sambuus Qudaar (Vegetable Samosa)  Author:  Abderazzaq Noor  Recipe by:  Shukri Ingredients Three large potatoes, boiled and diced into small cubes 1 cup of cooked green peas One large onion, diced finely 1 bunch of coriander, chopped 1 tablespoon of curry powder 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon ground coriander seeds _ teaspoon of ground chilli or two diced green chillies (optional) Salt to taste 10 sheets of spring roll pastry Oil for deep frying Instructions Sambuus Qudaar filling 1: Gently�cook the diced potatoes, peas, coriander, onions, salt and spices in a pan in a tablespoon of oil and cook for about five minutes. 2: Let the mixture cool. How to wrap the sambuus pastry (see pictures above) 1: Thaw the spring roll pastry and cover with a clean cloth to keep the pastry from drying out. 2: Mix two tablespoons of plain flour with a quarter cup of warm water to form a paste to seal the pastry�s edge. 3: Cut the two pastry sheets into thirds of equal size rectangles.� Repeat for the rest of the pastries, using two sheets at a time. In total, you will have 15 rectangles, each forming into one sambuus. Ensure that the pastry pieces are always kept covered with a clean cloth. 4: Fold the two sheets of rectangular pastry into pockets � see picture below. 5: Fill the pocket with about two tablespoons of the vegetable mixture. 6: Spread the flour paste along the edges of the final fold and seal the pastry completely. Ensure that the pastry does not have any holes.� You should have a neat triangular sambuus . A well folded sambuus will fry crisply and won�t be oily. 7: Repeat the process of filling and folding with the remaining pieces of pastry. Keep the pasties covered in cloth to ensure they don�t dry out. Frying the sambuus 1: Heat up oil in a deep frying pan on medium heat. Test the oil with a small strip of excess dough and if the pastry floats up then you are ready to start frying your sambuus . 2: Fry several sambuus at a time until they are a nice golden colour. 3: Drain the sambuus on a clean kitchen towel and serve with a wedge of lemon, lime or shidni sauce. � Prep time: 30 minutes Cook time: 2 hours Total time: 2.5 hours Serves: 8 - 10 people Share this recipe: Facebook Pinterest Google+ Twitter Email You might also like",

    "Name": "Fried coffee, anyone? (Bun Soomaali)",
    "Description": "Fried coffee? I know what you are thinking! It sounds weird, right? But let me tell you the taste is incredible and Somalis have some interesting stories that we associate with the bean. My beloved maternal grandparents introduced me to fried coffee beans at the tender age of five. This special dish was offered during meditation sessions called dhikr , an Islamic form of devotional chanting in praise of God. Somehow to this day, the smell of coffee brings to mind the sonorous, repetitive and ancient sounds of sacred chant, and I get instantly transported to a state of mental clarity. The d hikr group would sit on a mat and the coffee would be served floating in oil in a kurbin , a special wooden bowl. The kurbin would be passed around and we would start with a deep and appreciative sniff of the wonderful aroma, and then ladle a spoonful of the coffee onto the palm, chew the beans, and then rub the scented oil over our faces. This was part of the ritual and was said to prepare the person to face the world. Sometimes sugar is added to the bun to sweeten it.� Bun is also often eaten with popcorn or a simple dish of boiled azuki beans known as cambuulo . Coffee beans are called� bun �in the Somali language, and� buna �in Oromo and� bunna �in Amharic, the two other main languages of Ethiopia, the home of coffee. Somalis also associate bun with rites and spirit possession practices that hint at the ancient beliefs of Somalis. Ceremonies are held by a ritual expert, calanqad . Dancing, drumming, bun and the burning of incense are used to enhance the senses of participants. The spirit descends on the host under various names, sometimes speaking in different languages. Men and women participate in a ceremony called mingis , but women have their own ceremony called saar . If the spirit is vexatious, an exorcism is conducted by the calanqad . Not all spirits are cast out. Some become friends of the possessed person and are sometimes inherited by the children. Fried coffee beans also play a central role in ceremonies women hold to pray for the safe delivery of a pregnant friend. The oil used to fry the coffee beans is applied liberally on the head and hair of the pregnant woman as the women pray and sing for their friend. The Oromo people of Ethiopia, a Cushitic tribe like the Somali, also have a fried coffee ceremony. The outer skin is snipped off the coffee beans and words of blessings are uttered in a ritual known as buna-chiru , which signifies sacrifice to honour a guest or for a ceremony.

    "Name": "Somali Polenta Flat Bread (Muufo)",
    "Description": "Traditionally, Somalis bake muufo in a special clay oven called tinaar that is heated by charcoal. The muufo is flattened and stuck on the walls of the tinaar. No oil is ever used. You know the muufo is ready when it falls off the wall. � Muufo is a wonderful bread to serve with soup or stew. As Somalis settled in countries where they didn�t have access to a tinaar , they adapted by using a frying pan or a grill. Once the muufo is cooked on one side, the pan is flipped over to cook the other side directly over the gas flames. The result is an equally delicious flatbread though I have to say that the charcoal cooked tinaar gives the muufo a unique smoky flavour. Some people like to toast the muufo directly over the gas flames by flipping the frying pan onto the heat. This gives the muufo a charred look that makes the taste reminiscent of the muufo cooked in the traditional tinaar . Muufo cooked in this fashion is called muufo gedis (i.e. muufo that is turned). This method of cooking became popular in Somalia during the war as many small businesses such as the tinaar bakery shut down for safety reasons. Visits to the tinaar bakery are a nostalgic memory for girls who grew up in Somalia. It was the duty of young girls to buy the bread at the local tinaar . They would be given a tea towel or small bag to hold the bread and some money. Often, there would be a queue of people waiting for their muufo to be baked. The wait gave the girls a chance to catch up with friends and play. This recipe is from Faiza Hassan, a Somali Sydneysider, who is a wonderful cook. She remembers her mother making muufo in the tinaar in their house. It was years later in Australia that she wrote down her mother�s recipe and used the frying pan and grill to make the muufo bread.

    "Description": "Grains such as millet and sorghum are drought resistant and grow quickly in the semi-arid lands of the Somalis. It is no wonder that they are such an integral part of Somali cuisine. My grandmother used to make a thick porridge using garow (also called haruur ) or masago cadey (the Somali names for sorghum and hulled millet, respectively) with a drizzle of clarified butter and sugar. This recipe, which I have adapted for breakfast, is a modern take on an ancient recipe. Hulled millet looks like little balls rather like couscous and are full of protein, vitamin B, silica manganese, magnesium, and phosphorous. These grains are easily available in markets if you are lucky enough to live in Africa. �Most middle eastern grocery stores stock hulled millet. Sorghum in seed form isn�t as easily available, but most Indian grocery stores stock it as ground flour.

    "Description": "I don�t know what is more delicious � the dish or the story behind the origin of the dish�read on and you can decide for yourself� Umm Ali literally means the mother of Ali in Arabic. It is one of the most scrumptious bread puddings it has been my fortune to eat! Let�s get to the story now.� There are many variations of the story, but I have picked the most common one.� Umm Ali was the first wife the sultan Ezz El Din Aybek, whose rule began in 1250.� When the sultan died it was expected that the throne would pass onto the first wife�s first son � Ali.� However, the second wife also wanted her son to be the sultan. So Umm Ali arranged to pave the way to the throne for her son, Ali in a rather unique way.� She bribed wife number two�s handmaids and got them to beat her to death with slippers while she was having a bath! It is said that Umm Ali then made this dessert to celebrate her victory and her son, Ali�s ascension to the throne. There are many variations of the Umm Ali dessert. Some use different kinds of bread � pita, puff pastry, croissants or filo pastry or different nuts such as pistachio, almonds, and hazelnuts, among others. As children we used to eat a much simpler version made with sabaayad , a Somali flatbread, sugar and milk.� This recipe is my own take on the Egyptian Umm Ali, substituting pita bread or filo pastry (which is generally what is used in Egypt) with the Somali sabaayad and adding nuts, cream and spices.

    "Name": "Cardamom, Yoghurt and Fruit Pavlova",
    "Description": "My 11 year old son, Ilyas, is a determined fellow. Once he has his mind set on something, he�s got to do it. Fortunately, this time it was something quite innocuous. He just wanted to make something for his cousin�s birthday � something Australian and Somali, and preferably a meringue type cake, he said. You can�t get more Aussie than a pavlova or as we call it here � pav. The challenge was to somehow appropriate this classic Australian dessert into something Somali!� We hit on adding cardamom and yoghurt to give it that little twist. There is an interesting story about the origins of this delicious cake. Both Australia and New Zealand claim ownership of the dessert.� The truth is that no one knows who created the pavlova. The name and the recipe first began appearing soon after Russian prima ballerina, Anna Matveyevna Pavlova (1881-1931), toured both Australia and New Zealand in 1926 and Australia again in 1929. In 2010, the Oxford English Dictionary waded into the controversy and ruled that the first recorded pavlova recipe appeared in New Zealand in 1927. Of course, the dictionary folk are only interested in the origin of the word, but I am sure they had some fun riling up the Aussies and New Zealanders!� No doubt, the debate will continue especially now that we have muddied up the waters with the Somali appropriation of this wonderful dessert!� Here is hoping that the pav will find its way into the Somali lexicon probably as �baf� as we don�t have �p� or �v� in the Somali language! The cake turned out to be a massive hit and was finished in one sitting and we have received requests for a repeat performance. Happy birthday, Faiza!

However, Italians would be a little shocked when they discover just how much we�ve changed their pasta!� Somalis often add spices to the pasta sauce and it is common to find ingredients such as coriander and cumin included.� This fusion is what makes Somali food surprising and delicious.

During weddings and on major Islamic festivals such as Eid ul Fitr, kilos of halwa are either made or bought from the halwa makers and served to guests. Halwa is often served with strong black coffee called qahwa. The bitterness of the coffee cuts the sweetness of the halwa . Various forms of halwa exist in the Arab world and India.� The closest versions to Somali halwa are found in Yemen, Oman and the Kenyan and Tanzanian Indian Ocean coastal region. Making halwa is a laborious process. This is why it has become the speciality of artisans.� Every Somali neighbourhood has at least one reputed halwa maker. Sometimes we add nuts or sesame seeds. This gives the halwa a delicious crunch. Halwa can be preserved for several months and does not need to be refrigerated.

    "Name": "Muqmad (Preserved Meat)",
    "Description": "If there is one dish that is quintessentially Somali this is it!� I call it meat jerky Somali style. For the nomadic Somali people, food at its most basic is all about meat and milk ( hilib iyo caano ) and muqmad or odkac �is up for there for my people. The harsh desert climate and the constant travel meant that Somalis had to invent ways to make foods that would last for long periods of time, such as muqmad or odkac � which is preserved meat. The muqmad would keep for up to one year, which made it a wonderful source of continuous protein and energy for the ever roving nomads. Huge amounts of meat would be cut into thin strips and then sun dried. After a couple of days in the sun, the meat would be cut into tiny half a centimetre cubes and then deep fried and preserved in ghee. Once the meat was cooked it would be kept in a wooden container. Muqmad is also prepared for weddings and placed in a special container called xeedho (in the picture), which is decorated with leather and sea shells.� The xeedho is then be wrapped in cloth and given as a gift to the groom�s family members. As a child I remember my grandmother slicing the meat in our backyard and hanging it on the washing line!� It was my job and that of my siblings to sit by the clothesline and shoo the birds away, much as my uncles and aunts did in the desert, except of course they didn�t have clotheslines to hang their meat on. This muqmad recipe is from my mother via her mother and grandmother � ladies who were true nomads or reer guraa as we say in Somali.� My grandmother always liked to flavour the ghee with a bit of onion, garlic and cardamom. She said it gave the meat a wonderful depth of flavour, and everyone who�tastes it�agrees! This recipe doesn�t require you to cure the meat by drying it in the sun, and takes a short cut by simply deep frying it. Our local butcher has many Somali customers and has learnt to cut the meat in muqmad or odkac �style.� If you aren�t as lucky as we are, dice the lean beef into tiny quarter centimetre cubes. Muqmad is a favourite breakfast food and is usually eaten with sabaayad bread or anjero . If you�ve read this far then you should keep in touch!� Like The Somali Kitchen on�Facebook .

Anjero (written as canjeero in Somali) is also known as lahooh ( laxoox ). It is similar to the massive sized Ethiopian injera bread. The Somali version is smaller � dinner plate sized and thinner. Somalis make their anjero in various ways. Some people add eggs to the batter. Others use flours such as sorghum. Some Somalis don�t ferment their batter, but I like my anjero fermented. Fermentation gives anjero a tangy sourdough taste that is very moreish! The fermentation process takes two days. Keep a cupful of fermented batter in the fridge to start a fresh batch if you want to make more anjero. Breads similar to anjero are common in Yemen (where it is called lahoh ) and Israel where it was introduced by Yemeni Jews. Moroccans also make a similar bread called baghrir and eat it drizzled with honey and butter.

Place in the fridge for one hour. I use two meats because beef on its own can be dry while lamb on its own is too oily.

Cut into quarters. 6.�Dry fry the quarters on both sides one at a time for a minute on each side. Don�t overcook! 7.�When each quarter is dry-fried separate them and wrap with plastic. How to wrap the samosas 1.�Mix two tablespoons of plain flour with a quarter cup of warm water to form a paste to seal the samosa edge. 2.�Form each quarter into a cone shape by folding the sides from the rounded end over each other and seal with the paste. You should have a cone shape with a triangular shaped top that looks like an ice cream cone. 3.�Fill the cone with the mince mixture. 4.�Tuck the pointed top end down over the sealed edges and seal with the paste. You should now have a neat triangular samosa. Repeat with remaining pieces of pastry. Cooking the samosas 1.�Heat the oil in heavy shallow frying pan over medium heat. Test the oil with a small strip of excess dough and if the pastry floats up then you are ready to start frying your samosas. 2.�Place several samosas in your frying pan.

It is prepared in every Somali household during the fasting month of Ramadan, Eid festivals and wedding ceremonies. These festivals were never the same without kac kac . It is also great served hot for breakfast. Every Somali who went to a boarding school in East Africa will agree with me that kac kac was a delicacy that all boarding school students had to take to school. It certainly made us popular with our fellow students! Kac Kac is easy to carry and remains fresh for a long time in an airtight container. Its ability to stay fresh made kac kac a practical food for Somali nomads ( reer guraa ) and travellers to take on their long road trips, which would sometimes take months. Kac kac is also a wonderful snack for children�s school lunch, or as an afternoon snack when they come home.

The dish is usually served during weddings or community gatherings known as Zab or alla bari . Consequently many call the dish Zab . When I came to Australia I cooked Zab almost every other week. This was a great way to bring together my husband�s extended family and for my children to get to know their family and learn about the Somali culture. I cooked my first Zab when I was fifteen years of age for twenty people at my niece�s wanqal (a traditional Somali naming ceremony). This was a great achievement for me, and years later Zab has become my signature dish! This is a slow cooking dish, but most of the work will be done for you by the oven so don�t be scared to try it. I guarantee you that the results will be worth it! Serve the big chunks of tender meat on a bed of rice in a big dish for a Zab effect. There should be plenty to share for more than eight hungry people! If you have leftovers wrap the lamb in baking paper and a layer of foil paper.

Fish cooked in this way is particularly popular all along the east African coast and in Zanzibar.� The coconut is grated using a traditional mbuzi or grinder a nd the milk squeezed through a kifumbu , a sleeve shaped woven mat. The rich milk of the fresh coconut is called tui ya nazi and deepens the flavour of the spices and gives the fish a wonderfully nutty flavour.

    "Name": "Sabaayad (Somali Flatbread)",
    "Description": "Sabaayad is similar to the Indian paratha. This is versatile bread that can be eaten for breakfast, lunch, dinner or just by itself. For breakfast it is eaten with muqmad (dried camel or beef jerky) or fried eggs and a cup of tea. For lunch or dinner it can be accompanied by beef, chicken or vegetable curries. �My favourite way to eat it is to drizzle some honey on the sabaayad . My grandmother used to say that you would know a good cook by the flakiness of their sabayaad . Well, here is how you can make yours as flaky as my granny would want it! You can use all purpose white flour, but this results in a chewy sabaayad. I prefer adding in wholemeal wheat flour which makes the sabaayad soft. To make a circular shaped sabaayad , use your hands to roll the circle from one end to form a cigar like roll. Hold one end and roll into a snake like coil and tuck the end in. Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough into a thin circle. My grandmother rolled the dough twice applying oil with each roll. She said this makes the sabaayad extra flaky and I have to agree that this process does make for a super flaky bread. To make the sabaayad extra flaky roll the dough slightly after spreading the first tablespoonful of oil into a circle or a square. Roll it out again into a bigger circle or square ready for cooking.

Mix all the flour together with the salt. Add the oil and mix in thoroughly. Add in the water slowly as you knead the dough. When you are satisfied that you have a firm and elastic dough you know you�ve got it right. Let the dough rest for about half an hour. 2. Cut the dough into eight equal portions. Roll out each portion into a circle. Spread one teaspoon of oil and rub it gently all over the surface of the dough. To make the sabaayad square shaped, use a rolling pin to roll the circle and fold it into a square. This will allow you to achieve a square shape when you roll the dough. If the dough is sticky pat it with some flour. 3. Heat up a frying pan or griddle on the stove. When hot place the thinly rolled dough and let it cook for a minute or so. Once it starts to puff up flip the sabaayad and immediately spread a teaspoon of oil on top. Use a spatula to press down the bread all around. This makes it puff up more evenly. Flip and cook on the other side. 4. Remove from the heat and place on a plate.

    "Name": "Shidni (Chilli Sauce with Tamarind)",
    "Description": "This spicy chilli sauce is a favourite of all Somalis. Usually it is made as described below, but some people add dates. Another version is made with onions, tomatoes and lemon or with dates and tamarind . We have shidni with almost every meal. You can get tamarind either whole or in a paste form in any Indian or Somali grocery store. I recommend the paste as it is easier to use. The tamarind tree, which is called raqay or xamar in Somali (the latter is also the local name for the Somali capital Mogadishu) grows in the tropical parts of East Africa, including southern Somalia. The tree produces fleshy pods that are brown or reddish-brown when mature. The pods are soaked in water and squeezed to produce a thick acidic paste. When we were children we loved mixing the juice with water and sugar to make a refreshing drink, but that is a recipe for another day! Give shidni a go if you want to add a spicy kick to your meal. Incidentally, shidni makes a great dip for French fries or Dorito chips. Remember to pick the variety of chillies carefully. The colour and size of chillies are not indicative of the intensity of their flavour. The hottest part of the chilli is the membrane and the seeds. You can remove these to reduce the heat. You don�t want it too hot if you can�t bear the heat! And if the shidni is too hot please don�t drink water. Sipping some milk or yoghurt cools you down much faster. Want to learn getting your Somali pronunciation right? In Somali, the letter x is pronounced as an emphatic version of the letter h . If you are not Somali here is a fun way to learn how to make this sound�swallow a good spoonful of really hot shidni sauce. Did you just make an exhaling sound when the heat of the chilli hit your palate? Well, that is a good approximation of the Somali x ! Now that you have mastered this unique sound try saying xamar , the Somali word for tamarind. If you�ve read this far then you should keep in touch!� Like The Somali Kitchen on�Facebook .

    "Description": "The inspiration for this recipe came from one of my favourite chefs, vegan guru Tal Ronen who likes to use ancient grains. Tapping into my own ancient Horn of Africa heritage with its African and Middle Eastern influences I have used hulled millet, pomegranate and added ingredients that I don�t usually use such as black quinoa and artichokes. Millet is a common food in much of Africa where it is eaten as a breakfast food in the form of porridge. It is also cooked into a stiff polenta like dish that is served with either vegetables or a meat based sauce.�While many rave about quinoa, millet is not as well known in the western world, but it should be. It is a smart carb that is low GI and has been shown to produce lower blood sugar levels than wheat or rice. (Kamari and Sumathi, 2002). I also used artichokes in this recipe, a vegetable that I am not very familiar with. I have included pictures of how they look like before and after preparation below. Slice about 3/4 inch to an inch off the tip of the artichoke. Pull off any smaller leaves towards the base and on the stem. Wash them in cold water and boil them for about 30 minutes in water. See picture below for what the artichokes should look like once prepared. And this is what your dish could look like once cooked and all the ingredients assembled on the serving plate.

The shushumow also known as kalkals or zinanaande �(in Somali and Barawa languages) is shaped into small balls that is flattened and curled over a fork, deep fried and then tossed in a sugar syrup. The pastry shells are shaped using a fork and sometimes an afro comb (yes, you read that correctly, but of course use a new and sanitised one!). This recipe is courtesy of Hibo Jama of MyHalwad , a great instagram page that you should visit.�Hibo says that she chose the name MyHalwad �because she loves halwa (or xalwa , a popular Somali sweet). �I love xalwad . One day I was craving for it, but where I used to live there was no one who made it. They only got it from other cities. So I called my sister, and as always she told me how to cook xalwa over the phone step by step. It took me about ten tries or so, but I finally got it. Now I put my own twist on it, and that is where the name MyHalwad came from. Xalwa is one of my favorite things to cook,� she says. Hibo started cooking when she was a teenager, but the passion for cooking kicked some years later. �Now I love cooking and baking, and I have been cooking different cuisines for the last 14 years.

Make sure the comb is new and sanitised, and only use it for the shushumow . Instructions Preparing the shushumow 1. In an electric mixer mix all dough ingredients together except the water (and frying oil of course!) 2. Add the water slowly until you get soft dough. Mix for about 4-5 minutes. 3. Then let the dough rest for about 30 minutes. 4. Next cut the dough into small pieces roughly 1 inch x 1 inch. This should give you about 30 shushumow . 5. Shape them one at a time by pressing the dough on the back of the fork and curl it out toward the opposite side (away from you) 6. Preheat oil on medium heat. Fry the shushumow in the preheated oil a few at time, until golden brown. Make sure you turn the pastry frequently so that it cooks evenly. 7. Take them out and place them on a few layers of paper towels. This helps drain the oil from pastry. Preparing the syrup 1. For the syrup, use a medium size pan combine the sugar, cardamom and water together and let it come to a boil. Simmer for a couple of minutes and turn off the heat. 2. Then add all the shushumow to the pan and stir gently and ensure an even coating of the syrup. 3. Take the shushumow out and put them on a plate and let them cool down. The sugar will crystallise, but that�s part of the charm of shushumow ! Enjoy with a cup of Somali shaah .

    "Description": "These delicious bite sized rice cakes are a traditional Swahili breakfast and snack favourite, but I was delighted when I encountered them in the coastal cities of southern Somalia. They are crunchy outside, and soft and fragrant inside. In Swahili we call these delicious cakes vitumbua and macsharo in Somali. Growing up in Mombasa on the Kenyan coast I remember waking up to the call of the vitumbua sellers � vitumbua moto moto (hot, hot vitumbua ). Traditionally, we make the rice cakes in a small hollow pan which holds one cake at a time, but I couldn�t find this type of pan in Australia where I live now. Then a friend told me about the Danish Aebleskiver pan, a cast iron utensil that usually has nine holes � just perfect for cooking mini cakes and I was back in business! You can get the Aebleskiver pan on Amazon or eBay. Incidentally, the macsharo yariis recipe can also be used to make rice pancakes called vibibi and a rice cake also called macsharo or mkate wa sinia in Swahili. This recipe makes about 30 mini cakes. Serve warm with a cup of tea. If eating later, warm the cakes to soften the rice and enhance the flavours.

    "Description": "I don�t know what is more delicious � the dish or the story behind the origin of the dish�read on and you can decide for yourself� Umm Ali literally means the mother of Ali in Arabic. It is one of the most scrumptious bread puddings it has been my fortune to eat! Let�s get to the story now.� There are many variations of the story, but I have picked the most common one.� Umm Ali was the first wife the sultan Ezz El Din Aybek, whose rule began in 1250.� When the sultan died it was expected that the throne would pass onto the first wife�s first son � Ali.� However, the second wife also wanted her son to be the sultan. So Umm Ali arranged to pave the way to the throne for her son, Ali in a rather unique way.� She bribed wife number two�s handmaids and got them to beat her to death with slippers while she was having a bath! It is said that Umm Ali then made this dessert to celebrate her victory and her son, Ali�s ascension to the throne. There are many variations of the Umm Ali dessert. Some use different kinds of bread � pita, puff pastry, croissants or filo pastry or different nuts such as pistachio, almonds, and hazelnuts, among others. As children we used to eat a much simpler version made with sabaayad , a Somali flatbread, sugar and milk.� This recipe is my own take on the Egyptian Umm Ali, substituting pita bread or filo pastry (which is generally what is used in Egypt) with the Somali sabaayad and adding nuts, cream and spices. If you want to use sabaayad , you can find the recipe here.� It is equally delicious made with puff pastry.

    "Name": "Cardamom, Yoghurt and Fruit Pavlova",
    "Description": "My 11 year old son, Ilyas, is a determined fellow. Once he has his mind set on something, he�s got to do it. Fortunately, this time it was something quite innocuous. He just wanted to make something for his cousin�s birthday � something Australian and Somali, and preferably a meringue type cake, he said. You can�t get more Aussie than a pavlova or as we call it here � pav. The challenge was to somehow appropriate this classic Australian dessert into something Somali!� We hit on adding cardamom and yoghurt to give it that little twist. There is an interesting story about the origins of this delicious cake. Both Australia and New Zealand claim ownership of the dessert.� The truth is that no one knows who created the pavlova. The name and the recipe first began appearing soon after Russian prima ballerina, Anna Matveyevna Pavlova (1881-1931), toured both Australia and New Zealand in 1926 and Australia again in 1929. In 2010, the Oxford English Dictionary waded into the controversy and ruled that the first recorded pavlova recipe appeared in New Zealand in 1927. Of course, the dictionary folk are only interested in the origin of the word, but I am sure they had some fun riling up the Aussies and New Zealanders!� No doubt, the debate will continue especially now that we have muddied up the waters with the Somali appropriation of this wonderful dessert!� Here is hoping that the pav will find its way into the Somali lexicon probably as �baf� as we don�t have �p� or �v� in the Somali language! The cake turned out to be a massive hit and was finished in one sitting and we have received requests for a repeat performance. Happy birthday, Faiza!

    "Name": "Somali Halwa (Xalwa)",
    "Description": "Halwa is a glutinous sweet rather like Turkish delight. It is beyond delicious, but calorie laden so be warned! Somali halwa is synonymous with hospitality in our traditions. During weddings and on major Islamic festivals such as Eid ul Fitr, kilos of halwa are either made or bought from the halwa makers and served to guests. Halwa is often served with strong black coffee called qahwa. The bitterness of the coffee cuts the sweetness of the halwa . Various forms of halwa exist in the Arab world and India.� The closest versions to Somali halwa are found in Yemen, Oman and the Kenyan and Tanzanian Indian Ocean coastal region. Making halwa is a laborious process. This is why it has become the speciality of artisans.� Every Somali neighbourhood has at least one reputed halwa maker. Sometimes we add nuts or sesame seeds. This gives the halwa a delicious crunch. Halwa can be preserved for several months and does not need to be refrigerated.

Fava beans are a common food in north east Africa and much of the middle east, particularly in Egypt where it is known as ful medames. The Egyptians like their ful served boiled with a sprinkle of cumin, olive oil and a squeeze of lemon. I much prefer our saucier north east African version. What brings this dish to life is the addition of berbere, a spicy Ethiopian spice mix that contains ginger, cardamom, cloves, chillies, coriander, and other spices. You can get berbere in most African grocery stores. If you can�t get hold of berbere, use a tablespoon of ground spices that include minced ginger, ground cardamom, ground cumin, ground cinnamon, ground black pepper and paprika.

    "Name": "Fenugreek oil seared tofu, spring onions, cherry tomatoes with ginger and lime",
    "Description": "I was beyond flattered when I given the daunting challenge of putting my own twist to the famous chef Tal Ronnen�s vegan menu at the Wynn Luxury Resort in Las Vegas. I started the task with quite a bit of trepidation! This guy is one of the world�s most celebrated chefs, runs the Crossroads restaurant in Los Angeles, and is the author of The Conscious Cook, a New York Times bestselling cookbook. Tal Ronnen is also someone Oprah calls the world�s best vegan chef. I was also daunted by the fact that I had to choose one dish from the menus of the numerous restaurants at the Wynn , named in the�Cond� Nast Traveller� Gold List �as one of the �Top Hotels in the World�. I chose an organic olive oil seared tofu dish prepared with sundried tomatoes, green onions, ginger and lemon soy from Andrea�s, a Forbes Travel Guide Four Star award winning restaurant. I wanted to put a Somali touch to this dish and the idea of using fenugreek seeds and leaves came to mind. Fenugreek is used as a herb (fresh or dried) and a spice when in seed form. In Somali, we call it� hulbad (xulbad) . It is used to spice food and also as a herbal medicine to help women who are breast feeding improve their milk flows. I also decided to substitute the sun dried tomatoes in the original dish with fresh red and gold cherry tomatoes and saut�ed them in fenugreek flavoured oil and lime juice. The resulting juices acted as my dressing and was used in lieu of the lemon soy. I also added rocket leaves as I thought their peppery flavour would go well with the other ingredients. I was delighted with the delicate flavour imparted by the distinctive sweetness of the fenugreek seeds. The fresh tartness of the lime and the slightly caramelised onions, rocket, tomatoes and ginger added a tasty layer of flavour to the tofu. This is definitely a dish that I will cook again. Tal Ronnen, if you ever happen to read my humble take on your dish I hope you think I did a good interpretation! �And to anyone who uses this recipe, I hope you will enjoy the dish as much as I did.

They are crunchy outside, and soft and fragrant inside. In Swahili we call these delicious cakes vitumbua and macsharo in Somali. Growing up in Mombasa on the Kenyan coast I remember waking up to the call of the vitumbua sellers � vitumbua moto moto (hot, hot vitumbua ). Traditionally, we make the rice cakes in a small hollow pan which holds one cake at a time, but I couldn�t find this type of pan in Australia where I live now. Then a friend told me about the Danish Aebleskiver pan, a cast iron utensil that usually has nine holes � just perfect for cooking mini cakes and I was back in business! You can get the Aebleskiver pan on Amazon or eBay. Incidentally, the macsharo yariis recipe can also be used to make rice pancakes called vibibi and a rice cake also called macsharo or mkate wa sinia in Swahili. This recipe makes about 30 mini cakes.

    "Name": "Somali Polenta Flat Bread (Muufo)",
    "Description": "Traditionally, Somalis bake muufo in a special clay oven called tinaar that is heated by charcoal. The muufo is flattened and stuck on the walls of the tinaar. No oil is ever used. You know the muufo is ready when it falls off the wall. � Muufo is a wonderful bread to serve with soup or stew. As Somalis settled in countries where they didn�t have access to a tinaar , they adapted by using a frying pan or a grill. Once the muufo is cooked on one side, the pan is flipped over to cook the other side directly over the gas flames. The result is an equally delicious flatbread though I have to say that the charcoal cooked tinaar gives the muufo a unique smoky flavour. Some people like to toast the muufo directly over the gas flames by flipping the frying pan onto the heat. This gives the muufo a charred look that makes the taste reminiscent of the muufo cooked in the traditional tinaar . Muufo cooked in this fashion is called muufo gedis (i.e. muufo that is turned). This method of cooking became popular in Somalia during the war as many small businesses such as the tinaar bakery shut down for safety reasons. Visits to the tinaar bakery are a nostalgic memory for girls who grew up in Somalia. It was the duty of young girls to buy the bread at the local tinaar . They would be given a tea towel or small bag to hold the bread and some money. Often, there would be a queue of people waiting for their muufo to be baked. The wait gave the girls a chance to catch up with friends and play. This recipe is from Faiza Hassan, a Somali Sydneysider, who is a wonderful cook. She remembers her mother making muufo in the tinaar in their house. It was years later in Australia that she wrote down her mother�s recipe and used the frying pan and grill to make the muufo bread.

You can use canned chickpeas as it is more convenient and it tastes great too. Hummus can keep well in the fridge for up to a week.

    "Description": "I was beyond flattered when I given the daunting challenge of putting my own twist to the famous chef Tal Ronnen�s vegan menu at the Wynn Luxury Resort in Las Vegas. I started the task with quite a bit of trepidation! This guy is one of the world�s most celebrated chefs, runs the Crossroads restaurant in Los Angeles, and is the author of The Conscious Cook, a New York Times bestselling cookbook. Tal Ronnen is also someone Oprah calls the world�s best vegan chef. I was also daunted by the fact that I had to choose one dish from the menus of the numerous restaurants at the Wynn , named in the�Cond� Nast Traveller� Gold List �as one of the �Top Hotels in the World�. I chose an organic olive oil seared tofu dish prepared with sundried tomatoes, green onions, ginger and lemon soy from Andrea�s, a Forbes Travel Guide Four Star award winning restaurant. I wanted to put a Somali touch to this dish and the idea of using fenugreek seeds and leaves came to mind. Fenugreek is used as a herb (fresh or dried) and a spice when in seed form. In Somali, we call it� hulbad (xulbad) . It is used to spice food and also as a herbal medicine to help women who are breast feeding improve their milk flows. I also decided to substitute the sun dried tomatoes in the original dish with fresh red and gold cherry tomatoes and saut�ed them in fenugreek flavoured oil and lime juice. The resulting juices acted as my dressing and was used in lieu of the lemon soy. I also added rocket leaves as I thought their peppery flavour would go well with the other ingredients. I was delighted with the delicate flavour imparted by the distinctive sweetness of the fenugreek seeds. The fresh tartness of the lime and the slightly caramelised onions, rocket, tomatoes and ginger added a tasty layer of flavour to the tofu. This is definitely a dish that I will cook again. Tal Ronnen, if you ever happen to read my humble take on your dish I hope you think I did a good interpretation! �And to anyone who uses this recipe, I hope you will enjoy the dish as much as I did.

Other cultures have similar pastries.� The Spanish and Portuguese have empanada , the Polish are proud of their pirogi , the English and Aussies love their meatpie, and the Chinese continue to dazzle us with spring-rolls. In this recipe I have used spring roll pastry instead of the traditional handmade pastry. Using spring rolls is quick and easy, but if you prefer to make your own pastry, check out our meat sambuus recipe for instructions.

How to wrap the sambuus pastry (see pictures above) 1: Thaw the spring roll pastry and cover with a clean cloth to keep the pastry from drying out. 2: Mix two tablespoons of plain flour with a quarter cup of warm water to form a paste to seal the pastry�s edge. 3: Cut the two pastry sheets into thirds of equal size rectangles.� Repeat for the rest of the pastries, using two sheets at a time. In total, you will have 15 rectangles, each forming into one sambuus. Ensure that the pastry pieces are always kept covered with a clean cloth. 4: Fold the two sheets of rectangular pastry into pockets � see picture below. 5: Fill the pocket with about two tablespoons of the vegetable mixture. 6: Spread the flour paste along the edges of the final fold and seal the pastry completely. Ensure that the pastry does not have any holes.� You should have a neat triangular sambuus . A well folded sambuus will fry crisply and won�t be oily. 7: Repeat the process of filling and folding with the remaining pieces of pastry. Keep the pasties covered in cloth to ensure they don�t dry out. Frying the sambuus 1: Heat up oil in a deep frying pan on medium heat. Test the oil with a small strip of excess dough and if the pastry floats up then you are ready to start frying your sambuus . 2: Fry several sambuus at a time until they are a nice golden colour. 3: Drain the sambuus on a clean kitchen towel and serve with a wedge of lemon, lime or shidni sauce. � Prep time: 30 minutes Cook time: 2 hours Total time: 2.5 hours Serves: 8 - 10 people Share this recipe: Facebook Pinterest Google+ Twitter Email You might also like",

    "Description": "If you want something that is quick and easy to make you can�t go past corn in coconut sauce. This is one of those dishes that taste so complex that you�d think it takes massive effort to prepare. In fact what you do is literally put everything into the pot and enjoy the easy fruit of your labour! The only spice in this tropical dish is turmeric, which gives the corn a subtle earthy flavour and a lovely�golden colour. Corn is a staple food in much of Africa. In Somalia we eat it in a variety of ways � as a stiff polenta like dish called soor or as a porridge. Cooking it with coconut is my favourite way of preparing corn. I usually serve this as a side dish. It goes well with meat or vegetables. You can use light coconut milk if you are watching your figure!
